# SUMMARY OF THE PROJECT 
- *Performed intensive Web Scraping on the website Skytrax to gather customer reviews on British Airlines using python libraries **(BeautifulSoup)** and saved it on local desktop.*
- *Implemented **Natural Language Processing, Topic Modelling** tasks to dive into customer reviews and give a broad spectrum of the reviews generated. Some of the most used words were visualized through the reviews.*
- *Took into account customer bookings data and built a **predictive model** to gather important features that lead to a customer completing a booking.*

---

# TOOLS USED
*Python (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, NLTK, spaCy) was used for data cleaning, sentiment analysis, and model building.*
*NLP techniques were applied for review analysis, and Jupyter Notebook was used for the full workflow.*
*PowerPoint was used to present the insights in a business-friendly format.*
